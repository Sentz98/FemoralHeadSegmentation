# FemoralHeadSegmentation

Segmenting femoral head from hip CT image dataset with a medical image dataset. The dataset is publicly available at Musculoskeletal Research Laboratories (MRL) at university of Utah (https://mrl.sci.utah.edu/).

The data consist of CT arthrogram of human diarthrodial joints. The images are originally made from the subjects included in a finite element analysis of cartilage contact stresses for three study groups: 1) normal hip, 2) retroverted acetabula, and 3) traditional acetabular dysplasia. We use this dataset and tailor it to study the pelvis (femoral and acetabular bone and cartilage).

Here, are the tasks you need to go through for this assignment:

1-Become fully acquainted with the dataset and how it is made by reading thoroughly through the MRL webpage.

2-Download the data from the MRL webpage. You need to make a username and password; the rest is straightforward. Download the first 5 patient data for the three groups mentioned above.

3-To open the DICOM images in the dataset we use a software called ImageJ. Install ImageJ from ( https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html ) and load the data into it (drag and drop the folder containing the images), use virtual stack so you see images in one window as a video.

4-This is a 3-dimenssional (3D) data and images are taken in axial view. The images are from both legs and goes all the way up to the spine. You can see a picture of the hip joint below:
