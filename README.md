# Segmenting Femoral Head from Hip CT Image Dataset

## Introduction
This GitHub repository focuses on the segmentation of the femoral head from a publicly available CT image dataset, primarily designed for the study of diarthrodial joints at the Musculoskeletal Research Laboratories (MRL) of the University of Utah. The dataset comprises CT arthrograms of human diarthrodial joints and was originally created for finite element analysis of cartilage contact stresses within three study groups: normal hip, retroverted acetabula, and traditional acetabular dysplasia. In this project, we aim to adapt this dataset for the analysis of the pelvis, specifically focusing on the femoral and acetabular bone and cartilage.

## Tasks
To effectively work with this dataset and contribute to the segmentation of the femoral head, you should follow these steps:

1. Familiarize Yourself with the Dataset
Thoroughly understand the dataset's structure, contents, and the manner in which it was generated by exploring the detailed documentation available on the MRL webpage. This step is essential for interpreting the data correctly.

2. Download the Data
Access the dataset by visiting the Musculoskeletal Research Laboratories (MRL) webpage. You will need to create a username and password to access the data. Download the CT arthrogram images for the first five patients from each of the three study groups: normal hip, retroverted acetabula, and traditional acetabular dysplasia.

3. Image Visualization with ImageJ
To open and view the DICOM images in the dataset, you can use ImageJ, an open-source image processing software. You can download ImageJ from here. Once installed, simply drag and drop the folder containing the CT arthrogram images into ImageJ. Use the virtual stack feature to display the images as a video sequence in a single window, making it easier to work with the 3D data.

4. Understand the 3D Data
Bear in mind that this dataset is three-dimensional (3D), and the images are primarily acquired in the axial view. Additionally, the images cover both legs and extend up to the spine. Understanding the 3D nature of the data is crucial for accurate segmentation of the femoral head and other relevant structures.

By following these steps, you will be well-prepared to work with the dataset and contribute to the segmentation of the femoral head in this medical image dataset. Your work can have significant implications in the field of musculoskeletal research and medical imaging.
